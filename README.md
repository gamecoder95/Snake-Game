# Snake-Game
This is a 2D classic worm/snake game where the player tries to eat as many apples as possible that make the snake grow in length. Includes a few new modes such as teleporter, race against time, and mirror mode.

I made this personal project using C++ and the SFML 2.0 library. Image files were made using Photoshop CS6.
